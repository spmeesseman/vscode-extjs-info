This extension has surpassed where I was ever going to take it, and the time that ended up going into it were more than I ever intended.  Considering a pay scheme (cheap, e.g. $10 - $20), with free usage up to the # of to-be-determined number of parsed tasks.  Note the license, this codebase is NOT permitted to be copied or distributed without my permission.
